        <p><strong>The best time to visit Lakshadweep is between October and March.

            This is when the weather is most pleasant, with clear skies, calm seas, and comfortable temperatures. It's perfect for enjoying water sports, exploring the islands, and simply relaxing on the pristine beaches.
            
            Here's a quick breakdown:
        <l>
            <li>October to March: Ideal weather for sightseeing and water activities.
            </li>
            <li>April to May: Summer season with slightly hotter temperatures but still suitable for travel.</li>
            <li>June to September: Monsoon season with heavy rainfall and rough seas. Avoid traveling during this time.</l>
        </ul></strong></p>
